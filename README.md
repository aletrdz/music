MUSIC TRAVELS
=============

[Live site](http://atr313.nyuad.im/music/ "Music Travels")


For this project our goal was to create a website that, upon user input, would respond with data from 2 different APIs. Based on this criteria, I decided to develop Music Travels, a website that allows people to check where their favorite artists will have concerts soon and where they have been in 2016.

In order to make Music Travels happen I used the Bands in Town API along with the Google Maps API. I got all the artist information like pictures, concert dates and venue locations from the Bands in Town API and then I passed in this information to the Google Maps API to make a map that showed users the places where concerts had been held or will be held.

My inspiration to make Music Travels is that whenever I travel, one of the first things I do is check out gigs that will be happening in the city I’ll be visiting. Also, I have quite a few friends that are willing to travel just to see an act perform. I’ll be the first to admit that there already exist services that track where artists will be performing. However, these websites usually show users long lists of concert dates and venues. I’m a very visual person so having to go through long lists of concerts isn’t ideal for me. That’s why I thought that it would be really cool if you could have a map where you visualize the same information. In fact, I thought that finding because it’s easier just to locate a country in map then having to scroll down through a page.
